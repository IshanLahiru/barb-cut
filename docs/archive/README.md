# Archive

This folder holds documentation that is no longer active but kept for reference.

- **Payment system** – RevenueCat/payment docs and removal notes. The app no longer uses in-app payments; these are kept in case you re-enable them later.
- **Firebase one-time fixes** – `FIREBASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`, `FIREBASE_IMAGES_DEBUG.md` (past troubleshooting; main backend guide is in `../backend/`).
- **Image generation** – `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` (completion summaries; current guide is in `image-generation/README.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`).
